 Sugars: You'll need white sugar for the cake and confectioners' sugar for the frosting.
· Oil: A neutral oil, such as vegetable oil, adds moisture without imparting flavor.
· Eggs: Four whole eggs lend moisture and help bind the carrot cake batter together.
· Vanilla: Two teaspoons of vanilla extract for the cake (and one teaspoon for the frosting) enhances the flavor.
· Flour: All-purpose flour creates structure and brings the batter together.
· Leaveners: Baking soda and baking powder act as leaveners, which means they help the cake rise.
· Cinnamon: Ground cinnamon adds that warm, cozy flavor you associate with carrot cake.
· Salt: Salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, but it won't make the cake taste salty.
· Carrots: Of course, you'll need grated carrots!
· Pecans: Chopped pecans give the cake and frosting a pleasant crunch.
· Butter and cream cheese: Butter and cream cheese are the key ingredients in the light and fluffy cream cheese frosting.
